# MySQLQt

This was one of my college project which I have implemented a GUI to login into a MySQL host and execute queries.

# Structure

- `mysql,connector` was used to create connection to MySQL host and execute queries. 
- `PyQt` was used to implement GUI.
- `MVVM` architecture pattern was used to decouple different part of the project.

# How To Use
